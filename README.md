# Lucas Dixon, Research Scientist (iislucas.github.io)

I am a principal research scientist in Google DeepMind and co-lead of [PAIR](pair.withgoogle.com) (People and AI Research). I work on visualisation, interpretability and control of machine learning systems, and specifically language models.

Previously, I was Chief Scientist at [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.google.com/) where I founded engineering and research. I've worked on projects in a range of topics including digital security, formal logic, machine learning, and data visualization.

Before Google, I completed his PhD and worked in [the DREAM group](https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/the-history-of-the-dream-group) in [Informatics at the University of Edinburgh](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/) on the automation of mathematical reasoning, and later worked on graphical languages applied to quantum information. 

I also helped run a [non-profit working towards more rational and informed discussion and decision making](https://web.archive.org/web/20180315194233/http://www.kenyersel.org/), and was a co-founder of [TheoryMine](https://www.theorymine.com/), a playful take on automating mathematical discovery. 

Outside of scientific advances, I like martial arts.
